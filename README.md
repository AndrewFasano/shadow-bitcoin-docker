# shadow-bitcoin-docker

This repo provides a Docker file to build [Shadow Plugin Bitcoin](https://github.com/shadow/shadow-plugin-bitcoin) and also hosts a copy of the data generated by their experiment scripts.


The Docker file depends on the `shadow-standalone` container that can be obtained by running:
```
wget https://security.cs.georgetown.edu/shadow-docker-images/shadow-standalone.tar.gz.
gunzip -c shadow-standalone.tar.gz | docker load
```
For more information about building shadow-standalone, check the [shadow instructions](https://github.com/shadow/shadow/wiki/1-Installation-and-Setup#pre-built-images)
